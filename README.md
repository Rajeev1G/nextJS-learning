# nextJS-learning

This project was created so that I could learn and get familiar with the NextJS Framework


The Peject involved creating API's using the routing features of NextJS. There is also a simple front end built with SSR and authentication using JWT(JSON Web Token) and bcrypt. Authentication is persisted between pages and refreshes using cookies.
